    Thank you very much everyone for your congratulations!
    But many probably wondered why I didn't tell everyone that it was my birthday. The point is that I am Jehovah's
    Witness.
    I think that you certainly know about this religion, because we are trying to acquaint all people with the truth
    from
    the Bible, so we use the legal right to freedom of religion and the opportunity to acquaint all people with our
    religion. We follow the example of Jesus Christ to go where there are people and even visit people in their homes.
    And
    also we talk with people in the store, in the market, we call on the phone or now, in the pandemic, we write paper
    letters, as well as on the Internet. I do not know if you have heard or not, but Jehovah's Witnesses do not
    celebrate
    and do not celebrate any holidays except three:
    <ol>
      <li>this is the Lord's supper</li>
      <li>if someone gets married, it is allowed to give gifts, cards and congratulate the newlyweds</li>
      <li>if a newborn child is born, then we can also congratulate the parents on this event</li>
    </ol>





    We do not celebrate all other holidays and we also ask others who are in contact with us, so that they do not
    congratulate us and give us gifts on any holidays. Any other day, please, you can do it if you like. Therefore, I
    very
    much ask all of you personally, not to congratulate me again on any holidays and not to be surprised or offended
    that I
    do not congratulate you on any holidays. I really hope that you will understand me correctly and respect my position
    on
    this issue.
    But on the other hand, as Jehovah's Witness, I do not need any reason to do good to all people on any other day: to
    help, share something, support, give flowers, gifts or cards, just like that for no reason on any day. So if someone
    wants to do something pleasant, then this can be done absolutely any day! You don't need any reasons or special days
    for
    this. If you have any questions about this or any other matter regarding my religion, or in general about any
    question
    regarding any religion. I would be very happy to help. whether it be the topic of religion, God, the Bible and the
    Koran
    and everything, including questions about aliens, mysticism, astrology, esotericism and everything connected with
    it. I
    have been researching this for a very long time and I am ready to confirm any of my arguments with a documentary
    reliable scientific source. Until 1931, Jehovah's Witnesses were called Bible Students.

    With all this, I have great respect for any religion, opinion, traditions and beliefs. I believe that everyone has
    the
    right to believe in whatever he wants and in no case do I impose my beliefs on others.

    I see no reason to write something else further, so I already wrote
    I will add quite a lot just a link to the Internet site for those who are interested in learning about who the
    Jehovah’s Witnesses
    are.

    There you can watch a short video about it. Thank you very much for your attention!
